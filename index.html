            <div class="profile">
                <p>I'm Eduar Padilla, originally from Honduras, and I moved to the United States when I was about 8. My
                    interests are, philosophy, psychology, history, and technology, with a special focus on the latter.
                    This interest began when I was young, sparked by my love for video games and my dream of creating my
                    own. As I've explored technology more deeply, my fascination has only increased, seeing its major
                    impact on society and its potential for significant change. I'm especially captivated by artificial
                    intelligence and medical technology, amazed by their rapid growth and their crucial role in building
                    our global society. </p>
